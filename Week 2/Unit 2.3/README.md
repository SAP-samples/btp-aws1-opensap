### Step 1: Create required Page Variables in the SAP Build Apps application

1. Log in to SAP Build Apps and open the **Business partner-onboarding** application that you created in the previous exercise 2.2

    ![Alt text](./images/build-01.png)

2. Switch to the **VARIABLES** tab.

    ![Alt text](./images/build-02.png)

3. Choose **PAGE VARIABLES** and then click on **ADD PAGE VARIABLE**

4. Enter the **Variable name** as **fileUpload**, select the **Variable value type** as **List** and then select **List item type** as **Object**

    ![Alt text](./images/build-04.png)

5. In the **Add new property** field, enter the property name as **createdAt** and then click the **+** button.

    ![Alt text](./images/build-05.png)

6. Expand the **fileUpload** variable, click the **createAt** property and select **Variable value type** as **Date/time text(ISO 8601)**

    ![Alt text](./images/build-06.png)

7. Add 5 more properties to this **fileUpload** variable by repeating steps 5 and 6 above.

    Property Name | type | 
    --- | --- |
    mimeType | Text |
    modifiedAt | Date/time text(ISO 8601) |
    name | Text |
    path | Text |

9. Add another page variable with the name as **uploadUrl** and **Variable value type** as **Text** and Initial value as the value that you have noted as Invoke URL from **Section 3: Step 23** and append it with the bucket name that you have created.

    For example, if the invoke URL is **https://ajdgjafdaf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1** and the bucket name **test-bucket01**, then enter the Initial value
    as **https://ajdgjafdaf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/test-bucket01/**
