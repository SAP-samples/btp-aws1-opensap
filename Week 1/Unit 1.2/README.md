# Unit 1.2 SAP BTP Basics and Setup

This exercise is part of the openSAP course [Build Resilient Applications on SAP BTP with Amazon Web Services](https://open.sap.com/courses/aws1), Week 1 Unit 2 - SAP BTP Basics and Setup.

The objective of the exercise is to create a SAP BTP Trial account that you can further use throughout this course and beyond. 

If you already have an SAP BTP Trial account, you don't need to create a new one or move its content to a subaccount in another region! You can then skip this whole unit.

## Step 1 - Setting up BTP Trial

In this unit, we lay the foundation for the other weeks in this course. You will create your trial account and use SAP Business Technology Platform services to build business applications.
